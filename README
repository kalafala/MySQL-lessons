$mysql_dir = /usr/local/mysql/

To start mysql server:  sudo $mysql_dir/bin/mysqld_safe
	(Can also do so from Settings->mysql)

To shutdown mysql server: $mysql_dir/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
	On commands such as above, -u means user, -p means use-password and "shutdown" is simply the command we are passing
	Since "root" has a password established, we generally need the -p argument

To show available tables: $mysql_dir/bin/mysqlshow -u root -p mysql
