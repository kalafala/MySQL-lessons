$mysql_dir = /usr/local/mysql/

To start mysql server:  sudo $mysql_dir/bin/mysqld_safe
	(Can also do so from Settings->mysql)

To shutdown mysql server: $mysql_dir/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p shutdown
	On commands such as above, -u means user, -p means use-password and "shutdown" is simply the command we are passing
	Since "root" has a password established, we generally need the -p argument

To show available tables: $mysql_dir/bin/mysqlshow -u root -p mysql

	To show databases: show databases;

	To create a database:  create database mytest;
 
	To use a database:  use mytest;	

	To show tables: show tables;

	Example of how to create a table: 
create table mytable(id int(11) unsigned auto_increment primary key not null, username varchar(25) not null, passwd varchar(25) not null, email varchar(25) not null);

	To describe a table:  describe mytable;

	To insert values, e.g.,: insert into mytable(username, passwd, email)
    -> values('user1','passwd1','email1@domain.com');

	To print entire table:  select * from mytable;

	To print a specific column: select username from mytable;

	To select a specific row:  select * from mytable where id=2;
				   select * from mytable where username='user2'; <== note use of single-quotes for varchar username column, needs to be an _exact_ match
					// If text contains a literal quote, needs to be backslash'd
				   select * from mytable where id in (4,5,6)
				   select * from mytable where 1 order by rand() limit 1;
				   select distinct username from mytable; // Displays only user names and those that are distinct
				select distinct username,passwd from mytable; // Displays only username,passwd and those _combinations_ that are distinct
				select max(id) from mytable;

	To control ordering:  select * from mytable order by id DESC;

	To update a table entry:  update mytable  set passwd='passwd44' where id=4;

	To update all entries:  update mytable set passwd 'passwd';

	Another example updating a particular table entry:  update mytable set passwd='passwd1' where username='user1';

	To delete table entries:  delete from mytable where username='user3';

	To delete multiple table entries:  delete from mytable where username IN ('user1','user2');

	To delete a column: alter table mytable drop column email;

	To delete entire database: drop database mytest2;
